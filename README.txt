This mod features weapon replacement, skills and skill progression, magicka (or mana) and magicka potions, and a HUD that displays this mod's featured changes.

Using the included config file:

1: Fists
2: Sword
3: Dagger
4: Axe
5: Mace
6: Spear
7: Bow
8: Fireball
9: Drink Potion
0: Battle Talk


Weapon Replacement:

All vanilla Quake 2 weaponry has been replaced.  Combat will now be fought with FISTS, a SWORD, a DAGGER, an AXE, a MACE, a SPEAR, a BOW, and a FIREBALL SPELL
that uses magicka.

All players start with FISTS and FIREBALL SPELL.


Skills and Skill Progression:

Each weapon has a corresponding skill that determines a HIT/MISS when the weapon makes contact with an enemy.  The FISTS use the HAND-TO-HAND skill, the SWORD
uses the LONG BLADE skill, the DAGGER uses the SHORT BLADE skill, the AXE uses the AXES skill, the MACE uses the BLUNT skill, the SPEAR uses the SPEARS skill,
the BOW uses the MARKSMAN skill, and the FIREBALL SPELL uses the DESTRUCTION skill.

When you make contact to an enemy with a melee weapon, you are not guaranteed to damage them.  Depending on your skill with that weapon, you may MISS and not
do any damage at all.  When you do deal damage to the enemy, you gain some experience in that skill type and will eventually level up that skill with
continued use of the weapon.  The higher your skill with that weapon type, the lower the chance is that you will miss your target.  The BOW also acts this way
when an arrow makes contact with the target.  The FIREBALL SPELL is an exception.  Casting a fireball costs 5 magicka, but there is a chance to fail the cast
which will still use up the magicka cast cost but no fireball will be launched.  However, when a fireball is successfully casted, it has a 100% chance to deal
damage to the enemy it makes contact with.  DESTRUCTION skill experience is gained on successful fireball casts.

In addition to the weapon skills, there is an additional special skill, the ACROBATICS skill.  Experience is gained with every jump and increasing this skill
will allow the player to jump higher and/or further (the additional force can be controlled by the player's view angle.  Looking straight ahead will direct the
force straight up while looking at the ground will direct the force foward).

An additional way to increase skills is by picking up the new Skill Book item.  This item has replaced all item packs and will instantly increase a random skill by
5 levels.

The currently equipped weapon's corresponding skill and the acrobatics skill are displayed in the top left corner of the screen.

BEWARE:  Death eliminates knowledge.  Skills will reset after the death of the player.


Magicka and Potions:

Players now have a new resource, magicka.  Magicka is used to cast fireballs, is capped at 100, and is displayed in the top left corner of the screen.  In order
to restore magicka, players must drink magicka potions which are available throughout the map.  A player can drink a magicka potion by pressing 9 while having at
least one in their inventory (The amount of potions the player has is displayed in the top left corner of the screen).  Potions regenerate 50 magicka.


HUD:

The top left corner of the screen displays the player's current amount of magicka, the amount of potions they have, their currently equipped weapon's corresponding
skill, and their acrobatics skill.


Battle Talk:

While using the included config and PAK files, pressing 0 will cause the player to use battle talk.  This will make the player's character say something in game such
as "You Will Die!" or "This Is The End Of You!".
